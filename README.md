The zip folder contains 3 folders (Subway, Streetcar, and Bus).

Each folder contains its individual datasets used, ipynb file (python notebook), and the finalized dataset that is used for PowerBI.

To open the notebook, make sure to load it in any python environment and have the libraries installed to run every single code.

To open the PowerBI, go to PowerBI online and "import" the .pbix file, so you can click your own filtering as you'd like.
